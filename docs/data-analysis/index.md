Handling large dataset is an important part of daily academic work. However, few universities offer coding and
programming modules for their neuroscience courses. A proper data analysis of any kind starts with the understanding of
a program language and the understanding of every steps of the analysis pipeline. Only then, students can appreciate the
results of their experiments and engage in their critical interpretation.

Any data generated by Spikeling can be saved and exported.  The GUI comes with a simple built-in data analysis that
allows students to check their data and generate raster plots. From this simple analysis they could appreciate how
neuronal information is encoded within stochastic spike trains (see below).

This simple analysis could be used for home assignments in the early stages of student degree before engaging them in
developing their own analysis code.

For advanced data analysis and basic statistics, python notebooks are provided to serve as template for the teaching
staff. It is our hope to create a Spikeling community where users could share courses, exercises and data analysis 
scripts to be widely used in neuroscience and coding courses.
