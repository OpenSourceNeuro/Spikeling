Understanding how neurons encode and compute information is fundamental to our study of the brain, but opportunities for hands-on experience with neurophysiological techniques on living neurons are scarce in science education.

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
Due to budgetary constraints and logistical hurdles, few students can be afforded the opportunity to experience electrophysiological recordings on living neurons in action. Yet, a fundamental aspect of neuroscience courses is to understand electrical signalling within neurons and the transmission of signals across synapses, as well as the experimental techniques necessary to observe these properties.

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
To support university-level neuroscience teaching, we designed ‘Spikeling’, an open-source teaching support device that mimics the electrical properties of spiking neurons by running the computationally efficient yet versatile Izhikevich model.

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
It is an artificial neuron that can receive different inputs, integrate them and outputs its computation, just like a spiking neuron would!

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
Technically, it consists on a microcontroller (an ESP32) running the computationally efficient Izhikevich model of a spiking neuron.

The spikeling project emerged from local needs to teach neuroscience class modules for direct interaction with neuron physiology, data analysis, fluorescence imaging, protocol design, etc. The aim is to provide hands-on experience on how neurons encode information and how diverse variables modulates their activities, while engaging students with crucial aspects of data collection, experimental limitations, methodology and statistical analysis.

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
In order to give users a full interactive experience with the Spikeling neuron, a drawing engraved on the cover details in a neuro-morphic fashion all device functionalities. Furthermore, a spike-triggered LED and buzzer have been added to the device.

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
A dedicated GUI (Graphical User Interface) allows users to fully interact with Spikeling, plot all data generated and record them for further analysis.

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
Overall, Spikeling is a versatile device, allowing any teaching staff to conceive dry-lab tutorials or home assignments related to their own teaching course materials.
